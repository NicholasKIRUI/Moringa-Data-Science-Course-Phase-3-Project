### Project by: Nicholas Kirui
### Date of Submission: 01 September 2024

## Project overview

In this project, I will engage in the full data science process from start to finish, solving a classification problem using a dataset from the SyriaTel Customer Churn

## Stakeholder

Syriatel has been leading the Syrian mobile telecommunication market since 2000. The company has successfully established its reputation by focusing on customer satisfaction and social responsibility. Syriatel believes that its first responsibility is to offer its customers, a wide array of high quality products and services which meet their needs and make their life easier at reasonable prices.

In this project, the stakeholder is the Board of Directors and senior management of the SyriaTel Televommunications company. 
The Board od Directors and senior management are interested in knwowing if they can predict in advance the customers who are unhappy with their services and therefore likely to stop using the telecommunication services offered by the company in the near future. 

Once they are able to predict those customers likely to leave, they can put in place measures to retain these customers and therefore reduce the amount of money that is lost due to lost revenue because of customers leaving the company

## Business Problem

The business problem in this project is being able to predict whic customer is likely to leave the company in the next few months.
- Prediciting whic customer is likely to leave will enable the company put in place measures to retain the cutomers and therefore an increased likelihood of retaining the current company revenue.
